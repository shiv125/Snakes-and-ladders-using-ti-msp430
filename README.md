# Snakes-and-ladders-using-ti-msp430

This project requires basics of TI MSP 430 and programming in C.

The aim of the project is to make a full snake and ladder game for two
players, which contained a dice (a random number generator), two
LED grids (one for each player), and the controller (TI MSP 430).

Hardwares Used
• TI MSP430 F5529.
• LED Dot Matrix (7X5)
• 7 Segment Display
• Breadboards

Overview of the Code
• Generated a random number between 1 and 6 on 7 Segment Display
• Showed positions of the players on two different LED grids
• Programmed two switches for two players.
• Once the player wins, all the LEDs of that player will glow.
• If a player touches snake or ladder, LED will blink consecutively on
that location and the new location for some time.
